* ssp_load and ssp_save
load and save a ssp configuration file into / from the current settings.
** must serialize model reference
** must serialize model state
** must serialize inputs / outputs
** must serialize input / output state ?
** must serialize ssp status
** must add an entry to ssp status

* ndf_save
should perhaps be mapped to specific commands:
** ndf_save_morphology
** ndf_save_channel
** ndf_save

* tests_2_html
does not convert perl scripts to html,
eg. tests/scripts/model_state_purkinje.

* hierarchy/symbols
does `cat neurospaces/config.h`
which gives a warning when run in a arbitrary directory.
So 'perl -e "do symbols"' gives a warning neurospaces/config.h not found.
