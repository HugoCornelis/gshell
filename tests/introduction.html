    <h1>Integration Tests for the GENESIS 3 shell</h1>

    Below you find all the test specifications for the GENESIS 3
    shell.  The tests consist of the shell stand-alone as well as
    integration tests with Heccer and with the Neurospaces model
    container.

    <p>

      These tests should give a broad idea of the functionality of the
      shell.
